Ping Pong Game (kind of)

Using Python with PyQt6 library for diplaying the game interface/GUI. (For this reason you will have to install PyQt6
in your system using " pip install pyqt6 " or any other method that works for your OS)

GenAI - ChatGPT4o

Using Prompt-based for generating Python Ping Pong Game code responses. Ultimatily given up to 5-6 prompt to the ChatGPT4o to generate the entire code for the game (until my free trial ends huh).

If you really don't have anything to do and you are really bored, you might find yourself finishing the game and not receiving the credit you deserve (YOU WIN! type of hype)...That's b/c I reach the limit of trial ChatGPT4o test.

#### Overall, I recommend not to play this game if you don't want to have bad memories of Ping Pong game for a while ╹◡╹.
